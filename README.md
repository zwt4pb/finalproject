# Final Project - Joe Thompson (zwt4pb)

#### Part 1 - Data Ingestion and Analysis
DataProject2-1.ipynb contains the code for part 1 of the project, the data ingestion and analysis. api_data.docx contains the output that verifies consistent execution of the code each minute. Below is the analysis for this part.

I noticed a pattern between the factors. Each row involves that row number being cubed (i.e. 1^3, 2^3, 3^3, and so on). The pi column is numbers that are close to but never equal to pi. As the factor increases, they converge and get closer and closer to the true value of pi. Therefore, the increasing factor values may lead to increasing levels of precision in the calculation method for pi. The last column includes the time stamp, which increases by 60 seconds exactly every row for 3660 seconds total (1 hour).
